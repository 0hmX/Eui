make a yt-short on the topic " "

- must have a serious tone and occusanly have a joke in the script
- the ouput must be a json
- optimized the speech for ai tools like chatterBox
- avoid speech like a ai 
- each of the animtionn are passed individually so be descriptive as possible
- all the animation are made using manim a py libaray so no extneral assets
- no code diffes that are big
- only simple shapes and simple text will be used
- each animtion will atlset take 5s
- the script will be deeply techical;
- max 7 items
- start with eye catchy graphs and plots
- no "..." trippel dots in the speech or CAPITAL worlds they break in ai audio
- take a deep breath and write very meaning full world; do not woory about length; we will speed it up to fit if needed
- Always start by drawing a 2D grid! its like a trick to make people stay

example output
```json
[
	...,
	{
		"music-description": "<replace>",
		"speech": "<replace>",
		"animation-description": "<replace>",
		"duration": "<replace>s"
	},
